# Welcome on Hoc Momento

This project is a website for the theatre company Hoc Momento. They wanted a plateform to showcase their performances, their company and being contacted easily.

### Website
On the visitor's side, you have access to different pages about them. On each page i've tried to add interraction, so that the experience is as playful and pleasant as possible.
You can learn about the company, the shows and cultural actions they do, the team, their supports & partners and contact them.

### Back Office
This project also includes a back office that allows the company be in control of 90% of the website content. They can create, update, and delete the data of all pages except for the landing page, the company page and the contact page.

### Stack
The website was coded using express and EJS; i've used Mongo DB and Mongoose for the database. I also tried to part away from libraries as much as I could so i've used the DOM to activate most of the interractive features.

## Link
For now it's on Heroku, soon it will be online with it's wn domain name.
